/** Every value in this class that is used for training should be a double and
    not depend on another weight. In otherwords, it should follow this pattern:

    double NAME_IN_CAPS = -0.0;

    where the 0s can be changed by an arbitrary number of decimals. Anything
    else won't be picked up by the parser and you'll have to go modify the
    regex. Trust me, you don't want that so just stick to the pattern and we'll
    all be happier.
